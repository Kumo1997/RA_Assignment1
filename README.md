Galton Board Simulation
========================

Author: Xi Chen
Project: Randomazition Algorithm - Assignment 1
------------------------
Description:
------------------------

This project simulates a Galton Board (also known as a quincunx or bean machine) to visually and numerically demonstrate the central limit theorem. The simulation tracks the final positions of balls as they randomly bounce left or right through several levels of pegs, and compares the resulting empirical distribution with the theoretical binomial and normal distributions.

The project runs the simulation multiple times, averages the results, and then produces plots that illustrate how the binomial distribution converges to a normal distribution as both the number of balls (N) and the number of levels (n) increase.

------------------------
Requirements:
------------------------

To run the scripts, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.x**
- The following Python libraries:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scipy
  - csv

To install the necessary Python packages, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
------------------------


To run the simulation and generate plots, use the following command:

```bash
python Assignment1.py
```

To run the bash script, use the following command:

```bash
bash runme.bash   
```

To run the summarize.py script, use the following command:

```bash
python summarize.py
```
